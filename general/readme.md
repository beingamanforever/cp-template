Contains my cptemplate, debgging template, tasks.json to my cp setup.

If you want to use the same setup, do make sure to do the following things:
> make input.txt, output.txt and error.txt in the same folder as your main cpp file
> have the debug.cpp too in the same folder as the main file
> paste the tasks.json in your tasks.json and things shall work just fine (just make sure you have the same c++ version)

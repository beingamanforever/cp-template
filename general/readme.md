Contains my cptemplate, debgging template, tasks.json to my cp setup.

If you want to use the same setup, do make sure to do the following things:
1. make input.txt, output.txt and error.txt in the same folder as your main cpp file
2. have the debug.cpp too in the same folder as the main file
3. paste the tasks.json in your tasks.json and things shall work just fine (just make sure you have the same c++ version)
